CRS 2.x to 3.x rule renumbering utility
=======================================

In CRS 3.0, we have renumbered the rules to be more logical and helpful.
The new rule file names now correspond with the rule IDs in the file.
First rule of a given file is usually 9XX100, then the rules continue
in steps of ten. Related rules/siblings follow with a single digit
change (9XX101, etc.).

This utility replaces CRS 2 ruleIds with their CRS 3 counterparts.
You can use it when upgrading your CRS 2 exclusion/.conf files to CRS 3.0
or higher.

Example usage:

	./update.py -f your_old_modsec_conf.conf

As part of this we are providing idNumbering.csv and update.py (locating in the
crs2-renumbering folder). The CSV file lists the old rule IDs of CRS 2.2 with
the correspinding rule ID of the CRS 3.0 release, in case you want to update
your existing CRS 2 exceptions/exclusion files or check for conflicts.

Rules which have been removed in CRS 3 are listed with the new ID 000000 in the
CSV file. This means that the former rule is no longer part of CRS 3. If after
replacement you find the string 000000 in your config files, you can likely
remove this exclusion or special case.

A rule renumbering is painful for all existing installations. But we really
think that the rule IDs lacked sense and reason, and we are confident future
maintenance will be much easier once this is done. We appreciate your
understanding in this matter.

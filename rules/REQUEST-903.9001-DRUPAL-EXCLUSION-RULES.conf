# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# These exclusions remedy false positives in a default Drupal install.
# The exclusions are only active if crs_exclusions_drupal=1 is set.
# See rule 900130 in crs-setup.conf.example for instructions.

#
# POLICY 
#
# Drupal is a complex application that is hard to secure with
# the CRS. This set of exclusion rules aims to sanitise the CRS in a
# way that allows a default Drupal install to be installed and configured
# without much hassle as far as ModSecurity and the CRS are concerned.
#
# The exclusion rules are fairly straight forward in the sense that they
# disable CRS on a set of well-known parameter fields, that are known to
# be a source of false positives / false alarms of the CRS. This includes 
# namely the password fields and article/node bodies.
#
# The CRS rules covered by this ruleset are the rules with
# Paranoia Level 1 and 2. If you chose to run Paranoia Level 3 or 4,
# you will be facing additional false positives.
#
# This set of exclusion rules does not cover any additional modules
# outside of core.
#
# The exclusion rules are based on a Drupal 8.1.10.
#
# And finally: This set of exclusion rules is meant to be experimental.
# If you encounter false positives not covered by this rule file, then
# please report them. The aim is to be able to run Drupal in a seamless
# manner protected by ModSecurity / CRS up to the paranoia level 2.

== Report Bugs/Issues to GitHub Issues Tracker or the mailinglist ==

* There are still false positives for standard web applications in
  the default install (paranoia level 1). Please report these when 
  you encounter them. 
  False Positives from paranoia level 2 rules are less interesting,
  as we expect users to write exclusion rules for their alerts in
  the higher paranoia levels.
* Permanent blocking of clients based on previous user agent match /
  IP repudiation filter.
  This is On by default in CRSv3.0.0-RC1, but will be off by default
  for the full release.

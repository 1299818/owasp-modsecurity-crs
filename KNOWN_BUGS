* There are still false positives for standard web applications in
  the default install (paranoia level 1). Please report these when
  you encounter them.
  False Positives from paranoia level 2 rules are less interesting,
  as we expect users to write exclusion rules for their alerts in
  the higher paranoia levels.
* Permanent blocking of clients is based on a previous user agent / IP
  combination. Changing the user agent will thus allow to bypass
  this new filter. The plan is to allow for a purely IP based
  filter in the future.
* Apache 2.4 prior to 2.4.11 is affected by a bug, which causes
  the server to fail during startup with an error pointing to various
  lines in the CRS ruleset.

  This bug is known to plague RHEL 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS users.
  We advise to update your apache version.
  A workaround exists: You can try and enter empty lines into your
  rule files until the error disappears. Please be aware that this
  will mean that updates to the rulesets will have to be done by
  hand in the future as you are changing the rule files.
